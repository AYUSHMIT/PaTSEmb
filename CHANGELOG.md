## [0.1.0] - 2024-08-27

First release of `PaTSEmb`! While our toolbox is still a work in progress, 
we believe it is already in a usable stage. Additionally, by publicly releasing 
`PaTSEmb`, we hope to receive feedback from the community! Be sure to check 
out the [documentation](https://patsemb-u0143709-3a07c9d27a51b62b1b2bad2f623ad154a9a19db833f1f7.pages.gitlab.kuleuven.be/)
for additional information!

### Added
A summary of the available modules within ``PaTSEmb`` is given below:
- `discretization`: a module converting a time series into a symbolic representation.
- `pattern_based_embedding`: a module for effectively transforming a time series into
  the pattern-based embedding.
- `pattern_mining`:  a module for mining patterns within the symbolic representations.
- `postprocess`: a module for postprocessing the constructed pattern-based embedding.
- `visualization`: a simple module to visualize the time series and embedding.
